# SML - Programming languages

This repository contains programming challenges tackled with SML.

SML stands for Standard Meta Language, a dialect of the ML family of programming languages.

On a quest to ramp up my programming abilities, I am using SML, Racket and Ruby as vehicles
to reach my Zen of programming.
